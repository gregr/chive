================================================================
= Recommendations
================================================================
Until the core libraries are finished, the best way to experiment with this
project is to run the following:

python3 chive.py -ibt boot.chive

This will evaluate the boot.chive file and drop you into interactive mode.

= Interpreter Overview
================================================================
Phases of interpretation:

    text -> (parser) -> s-exprs -> (evaluator) -> values

A closer look at how the evaluator processes each s-expr:

    s-expr -> (expand) -> s-expr -> (semantize) -> AST -> (eval) -> value

= Work In Progress

Bootstrap interpreter implemented in python 3
