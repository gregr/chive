don't truncate handler stack upon finding a handler
      -unwound handlers pop themselves
derive throw and build on that
restart lists need to be segmented by interleaved handler pushes

notion of tags separate from types/constructors (and used for dispatch)
capabilities/effects
encapsulation of namespace contexts
  -separation of the invoking context vs. invoked
reader macros/importing them
nicer list syntax using reader macros
rename primitives without using leading-#
conditions: signals/restarts
type-error hook
weak ref
gc-stable ref (related?: distributed refs)
module-determined constancy/visibility typing
explicit full mutability typing
getTag primitive for explicit dynamic dispatch
smarter thunk-creation
fix future bugs due to lack of Context.withThread where required
expansion history (fix) and attributes for definitions
debugging (improve)
optional automatic downcasting with warnings
option for direct file-inclusion
interpreter-agnostic expression evaluation
import path [modname] [[only (...)]|[hide (...)]] [rename (...)]]
thread interaction with delays, module-loading, etc.
AST pretty-printing
arrays
strings
structs/tuples
records/row-typing
dependency analysis
           -driving the eval order of non-sequenced exprs/typedefs
           -searching mutually-recursive modules for missing dependencies

OOP:
  -constructors build a new record containing method closures and data attrs
  -constructor-impls take any record containing the required slots
    -inheritance:
      -new constructor applies old constructor-impl to new record type
        -allows more efficient polymorphic delegation than a layered approach
        -mixins seem easy enough
        -takes advantage of row-typing for records
        -extensibility?
  -orthogonal dynamic properties?
  -prototypes?
reflection:
  -show field names
  -show field names with short or full value descriptions

deferred compiler/interpreter (eval instead of compile for pure interpreters):
given a list of inputs assumed present at compile-time;
  causes some input ops to become pure
  default list includes module paths (explicit exclusion allows late-loading)
eval definitions, compute dependencies
postpone eval of pure value exprs until demanded, but compute dependencies
compile effectful exprs (after demanding their dependencies)
eval pure values when expansion requires it
no need to compile unneeded definitions/pure exprs
if expansion relies on runtime input, compile the continued expansion/eval;
  you end up having to compile interpreter/jit compiler into the executable
Root db usage (multimethods, record fields of tags, etc.) in exprs implies dynamic switch (can be inlined during proc specialization; can be made into static switch using type information)
