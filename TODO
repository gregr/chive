================================================================
exprs: change expand to a proc; eliminate eval; add letrec
use the type/storage system for expressing data
associate unique tag with each consproc/foreignproc/delay
tag primitive values for safe debugging
track element tags (introduce tag unions, subtags/subtypes)
guard against infinite recursion in pretty-printing
AST pretty-printing
structs/tuples

deferred compiler/interpreter (eval instead of compile for pure interpreters):
given a list of inputs assumed present at compile-time;
  causes some input ops to become pure
  default list includes module paths (explicit exclusion allows late-loading)
eval definitions, compute dependencies
postpone eval of pure value exprs until demanded, but compute dependencies
compile effectful exprs (after demanding their dependencies)
eval pure values when expansion requires it
no need to compile unneeded definitions/pure exprs
if expansion relies on runtime input, compile the continued expansion/eval;
  you end up having to compile interpreter/jit compiler into the executable
Root db usage (multimethods, record fields of tags, etc.) in exprs implies dynamic switch (can be inlined during proc specialization; can be made into static switch using type information)
