status description
breaking/stepping
procedure tracing: prune iterative recalls

# do these need to be in the debugger directly?
# alternative: start a new interactive evaluator and provide these primitives
eval
expand
expand-once (single-step expansion)
inspect (inspect result of last eval)
show traced
find/locate (source location of a definition)
break

debugger proper
---------------
show/view
        status: stepping or stopped (error)
        context (is this necessary given the other options?)
where (show current line; possibly some surrounding lines)

breaking
        set/unset breakpoint; by line, by procedure? conditional?
        show breakpoints
stepping
        next
        over
        out
resume (continue running without stepping)

================================================================
= conditions
================================================================
interactive default handler
---------------------------
break (enter the debugger to have a look around)
show
        condition
        restarts
restart (choosing a restart from shown list)
continue
         not applicable for non-continuable conditions such as errors
         given a value to return to the signalling computation
----------------------------------------------------------------
don't truncate handler stack upon finding a handler
      -unwound handlers pop themselves
derive throw and build on that
restart lists need to be segmented by interleaved handler pushes

conditions: signals/restarts
type-error hook

================================================================
= general
================================================================
multimethods
case/match

field annotations in product type definitions: implicit set-projection

================================================================
= modules
================================================================
../ and ./ relative paths, / absolute path, otherwise use search path
more flexible environment linking
     changes in opened modules should become visible in client modules
     allow for namespace reloading
parser
        default reader as a parser with configurable read-table
        reader macros: importing/exporting them

make-foo a b c =
         module
                compound-interface
                        export (x y) (macros and types) (ops and readtable-strings)
                        export (z)
                namespace
                        import (a b c)
                        open [core std]
                        inline
                                d e f = ...
                                g = ...
                        files ["blah" "bleh"]
                        text "j k = ..."

================================================================
= low-level
================================================================
weak ref
gc-stable ref (related?: distributed refs)
smarter thunk-creation
fix future bugs due to lack of Context.withThread where required
interpreter-agnostic expression evaluation
thread interaction with delays, module-loading, etc.

ffi:
        networking
        filesystem/stdio/os
        threads/processes/signals?

================================================================
= security
================================================================
security implications of ctx argument to macros?
         a context can list valid symbols that it may be closed over (hygiene)
limited expand privileges? sealed expansions?
hygienic macro auditing
auditing for global communication channels
safety of exceptions or conditions/restarts
resource limits
thread state

module/environment-annotated symbols rather than gensym for renaming?
privileged scope (master of the machine) contains operators to inspect/debug/modify/execute anything subordinate to it
implies virtual machine hierarchies: machines that simulate machines that simulate machines...
parent machines do not need to trust child machines

================================================================
= types
================================================================
optional automatic downcasting with warnings
structs/tuples
records/row-typing
capabilities/effects
constant/mutable regions
lifted/unlifted regions

================================================================
= startup
================================================================
current startup sequence
        boot script builds core module from primitives (optionally skip)
        start user program with core (with primitives if boot is skipped)
future startup options
        1. run a boot script to build a basic program image from primitives
        2. load and execute an existing image (possibly with less privileges)

================================================================
= future
================================================================
dependency analysis
           -driving the eval order of non-sequenced exprs/typedefs
           -searching mutually-recursive modules for missing dependencies

OOP:
  -constructors build a new record containing method closures and data attrs
  -constructor-impls take any record containing the required slots
    -inheritance:
      -new constructor applies old constructor-impl to new record type
        -allows more efficient polymorphic delegation than a layered approach
        -mixins seem easy enough
        -takes advantage of row-typing for records
        -extensibility?
  -orthogonal dynamic properties?
  -prototypes?
reflection:
  -show field names
  -show field names with short or full value descriptions
