================================================================
readtable-based parsing
nicer list syntax using reader macros
underscore symbol is special (allow it to be repeated as an arg; don't bind it)
notion of tags separate from types/constructors (and used for dispatch)
getTag primitive for explicit dynamic dispatch
field projection operator
AST pretty-printing
no ad-hoc local environment or namespace access
   they can still be explicitly constructed/passed around
debugging inspector
          should not require eval to operate on local environments
                 eval should operate on namespaces
          therefore needs implementation-specific introspection privileges
expansion history (fix) and source annotations for definitions

================================================================
= modules
================================================================
../ and ./ relative paths, / absolute path, otherwise use search path
more flexible environment linking
     changes in opened modules should become visible in client modules
     allow for namespace reloading
parser
        default reader as a parser with configurable read-table
        reader macros: importing/exporting them

make-foo a b c =
         module
                compound-interface
                        export (x y) (macros and types) (ops and readtable-strings)
                        export (z)
                namespace
                        import (a b c)
                        open [core std]
                        inline
                                d e f = ...
                                g = ...
                        files ["blah" "bleh"]
                        text "j k = ..."

================================================================
= conditions
================================================================
don't truncate handler stack upon finding a handler
      -unwound handlers pop themselves
derive throw and build on that
restart lists need to be segmented by interleaved handler pushes

conditions: signals/restarts
type-error hook

================================================================
= low-level
================================================================
weak ref
gc-stable ref (related?: distributed refs)
smarter thunk-creation
fix future bugs due to lack of Context.withThread where required
interpreter-agnostic expression evaluation
thread interaction with delays, module-loading, etc.

ffi:
        networking
        filesystem/stdio/os
        threads/processes/signals?

================================================================
= security
================================================================
security implications of ctx argument to macros?
         a context can list valid symbols that it may be closed over (hygiene)
limited expand privileges? sealed expansions?
hygienic macro auditing
auditing for global communication channels
safety of exceptions or conditions/restarts
resource limits
thread state

module/environment-annotated symbols rather than gensym for renaming?
privileged scope (master of the machine) contains operators to inspect/debug/modify/execute anything subordinate to it
implies virtual machine hierarchies: machines that simulate machines that simulate machines...
parent machines do not need to trust child machines

================================================================
= types
================================================================
optional automatic downcasting with warnings
thunk/strict-typing
capabilities/effects
structs/tuples
records/row-typing
constancy vs. mutability
          -type annotations that include regions?
          -to freeze existing values, copy/pray? (hope for optimization)

================================================================
= startup
================================================================
current startup sequence
        boot script builds core module from primitives (optionally skip)
        start user program with core (with primitives if boot is skipped)
future startup options
        1. run a boot script to build a basic program image from primitives
        2. load and execute an existing image (possibly with less privileges)

================================================================
= future
================================================================
dependency analysis
           -driving the eval order of non-sequenced exprs/typedefs
           -searching mutually-recursive modules for missing dependencies

OOP:
  -constructors build a new record containing method closures and data attrs
  -constructor-impls take any record containing the required slots
    -inheritance:
      -new constructor applies old constructor-impl to new record type
        -allows more efficient polymorphic delegation than a layered approach
        -mixins seem easy enough
        -takes advantage of row-typing for records
        -extensibility?
  -orthogonal dynamic properties?
  -prototypes?
reflection:
  -show field names
  -show field names with short or full value descriptions

deferred compiler/interpreter (eval instead of compile for pure interpreters):
given a list of inputs assumed present at compile-time;
  causes some input ops to become pure
  default list includes module paths (explicit exclusion allows late-loading)
eval definitions, compute dependencies
postpone eval of pure value exprs until demanded, but compute dependencies
compile effectful exprs (after demanding their dependencies)
eval pure values when expansion requires it
no need to compile unneeded definitions/pure exprs
if expansion relies on runtime input, compile the continued expansion/eval;
  you end up having to compile interpreter/jit compiler into the executable
Root db usage (multimethods, record fields of tags, etc.) in exprs implies dynamic switch (can be inlined during proc specialization; can be made into static switch using type information)
